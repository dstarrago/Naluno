This is a board game. At the beginning of the game, the same number of chips is distributed to each player. Chips are square shaped, and each has a double arch figure printed on one of its surfaces, which makes contact at three different points on any of the four edges of the chip.

The players play in turns. At the time of playing, a player selects one of his chips and places it on the table so that the ends of the arcs of his chip make contact with at least one of the ends of the arcs of some of the chip that have been previously played. No arc end can be truncated by the played chip. If the played chip contacts two or more arc ends, the player plays again, otherwise the turn is for the next player. The player who first runs out of chips wins the game.
