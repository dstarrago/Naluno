This is a board game. At the beginning of the game, same number of pieces is distributed to each player. Pieces are square shaped, and each has a double arch figure printed on one of its surfaces, which makes contact at three different points on any of the four edges of the piece.

Players play in turns. At the time of playing, a player selects one of his pieces and places it on the table so that at least one of its arc is in contact with the arc of any previously played piece. No arc's end can be truncated by the played piece. If the played piece contacts two or more arcs, the player plays again, otherwise the turn is for the next player. The winner of the game is the player who first runs out of pieces.
